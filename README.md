# UAI-2022-Competition
A machine learning project. 
Designed a machine learning model for solving the Multi-Label Classification (MLC) task. 
Given a Markov Network, determined the most probable assignment to query variables using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Dataset Description: Given a set of 4 datasets, each dataset contained the following files: 1. Model file: Contained description of the Markov network that has been used to generate the data in the UAI format. 2. Data file: Contained training data (X) partitioned into sets of evidence (E), query (Q) and hidden (H) variables.

Problem Description: The multi-label classification task is defined as finding the most-probable assignment to the set of query variables Q given an assignment of values to the evidence variables E = e. Hence, In other words, the task was to find the most-probable assignment to the query variables given an assignment of values to the evidence variables for several Markov networks (separately) known ahead of time. Used Logistic Regression and Random Forest to solve the task.
